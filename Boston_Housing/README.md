## Boston Housing - Machine Learning
Boston Housing is a model that attempts to apply various machine learning algorithms for training, and then uploads the prediction results generated by the trained model to Kaggle challenges.
### Dataset
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing">Boston Housing Dataset</a>
### Process (all you can find in Boston_Housing file):
#### Checking if there are missing datas
#### Features Analysis
* Using the SelectKBest() model to get the performance of each features
* After feature analysis, one with all features included and another with the 'chas' feature removed, trained simultaneously
#### Using Cross validation to evaluate the performance of 12 models with two type dataset
XGB, Bagging, R-Forest, and also keep SVM model to next step because SVM's structure is diferente from models selected
#### Traning selected models
* Setting pipeline
* Using Grid Search to perform hyperparameter optimization
* Building the GridSearchCV model to get the best parameters of each model selected
#### Getting preditions from Test dataset for kaggle competition
